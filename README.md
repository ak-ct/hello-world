Nothing special

Hello fellow nerds!

I'm new here. I bought a Xiaomi camera and was hoping to find a way not to use their app to stream the feed. That's how I discovered this website. I found a thread with people working on getting a RTSP running but since I'm so new, I have no idea how to implement it. I'll see how far I can get myself before asking for help!
